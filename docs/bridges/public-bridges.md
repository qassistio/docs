# Public Bridges

QAssist provides several public bridges that you can use to communicate with your machines.


The bridges listed on this page communicate securely using strong encryption. The credentials and
details are not saved after a session is ended and are only used to communicate with the machine.


The bridges need to be able to connect to the machines on the configured IP address/hostname and port,
using the configured protocol.


Below you can find the bridges and their respective IP addresses that they will communicate with.
If you don't want to expose your machines to the internet, you can allow-list the
IP addresses for the bridge the machine is configured for.


## Regional Bridges

When configuring a machine, select a bridge that is close to the endpoint machine to reduce any latency,
the available regions are:

### Europe

`eu.bridges.qassist.io`

### USA

`us.bridges.qassist.io`
